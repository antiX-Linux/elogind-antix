.SH "NAME"
logind.conf \- Login manager configuration files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/etc/elogind/logind\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These files configure various parameters of the elogind login manager\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. By default, the configuration file in
/etc/elogind/
contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. This file can be edited to create local overrides\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install configuration snippets in
/usr/lib/elogind/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. The main configuration file is read before any of the configuration directories, and has the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any configuration directory override entries in the single configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the subdirectories they reside in\&. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name takes precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All login options are configured in the
"[Login]"
section, system sleep options are configured in the
"[Sleep]"
section\&.
.SS "[Login] section:"
.PP
\fIKillUserProcesses=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. Configures whether the processes of a user should be killed when the user completely logs out (i\&.e\&. after the user\*(Aqs last session ended)\&. Defaults to
"no"\&.
.sp
Note that setting
\fIKillUserProcesses=1\fR
will break tools like
\fBscreen\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKillOnlyUsers=\fR, \fIKillExcludeUsers=\fR
.RS 4
These settings take space\-separated lists of usernames that influence the effect of
\fIKillUserProcesses=\fR\&. If not empty, only processes of users listed in
\fIKillOnlyUsers=\fR
will be killed when they log out entirely\&. Processes of users listed in
\fIKillExcludeUsers=\fR
are excluded from being killed\&.
\fIKillExcludeUsers=\fR
defaults to
"root"
and takes precedence over
\fIKillOnlyUsers=\fR, which defaults to the empty list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIdleAction=\fR
.RS 4
Configures the action to take when the system is idle\&. Takes one of
"ignore",
"poweroff",
"reboot",
"halt",
"kexec",
"suspend",
"hibernate",
"hybrid\-sleep", and
"lock"\&. Defaults to
"ignore"\&.
.sp
Note that this requires that user sessions correctly report the idle status to the system\&. The system will execute the action after all sessions report that they are idle, no idle inhibitor lock is active, and subsequently, the time configured with
\fIIdleActionSec=\fR
(see below) has expired\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIdleActionSec=\fR
.RS 4
Configures the delay after which the action configured in
\fIIdleAction=\fR
(see above) is taken after the system is idle\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIInhibitDelayMaxSec=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum time a system shutdown or sleep request is delayed due to an inhibitor lock of type
"delay"
being active before the inhibitor is ignored and the operation executes anyway\&. Defaults to 5\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIHandlePowerKey=\fR, \fIHandleSuspendKey=\fR, \fIHandleHibernateKey=\fR, \fIHandleLidSwitch=\fR, \fIHandleLidSwitchDocked=\fR
.RS 4
Controls how logind shall handle the system power and sleep keys and the lid switch to trigger actions such as system power\-off or suspend\&. Can be one of
"ignore",
"poweroff",
"reboot",
"halt",
"kexec",
"suspend",
"hibernate",
"hybrid\-sleep", and
"lock"\&. If
"ignore", logind will never handle these keys\&. If
"lock", all running sessions will be screen\-locked; otherwise, the specified action will be taken in the respective event\&. Only input devices with the
"power\-switch"
udev tag will be watched for key/lid switch events\&.
\fIHandlePowerKey=\fR
defaults to
"poweroff"\&.
\fIHandleSuspendKey=\fR
and
\fIHandleLidSwitch=\fR
default to
"suspend"\&.
\fIHandleLidSwitchDocked=\fR
defaults to
"ignore"\&.
\fIHandleHibernateKey=\fR
defaults to
"hibernate"\&. If the system is inserted in a docking station, or if more than one display is connected, the action specified by
\fIHandleLidSwitchDocked=\fR
occurs; otherwise the
\fIHandleLidSwitch=\fR
action occurs\&.
.sp
A different application may disable logind\*(Aqs handling of system power and sleep keys and the lid switch by taking a low\-level inhibitor lock ("handle\-power\-key", "handle\-suspend\-key", "handle\-hibernate\-key", "handle\-lid\-switch")\&. This is most commonly used by graphical desktop environments to take over suspend and hibernation handling, and to use their own configuration mechanisms\&. If a low\-level inhibitor lock is taken, logind will not take any action when that key or switch is triggered and the
\fIHandle*=\fR
settings are irrelevant\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=\fR, \fISuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=\fR, \fIHibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=\fR, \fILidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=\fR
.RS 4
Controls whether actions that
\fBsystemd\-logind\fR
takes when the power and sleep keys and the lid switch are triggered are subject to high\-level inhibitor locks ("shutdown", "sleep", "idle")\&. Low level inhibitor locks ("handle\-*\-key"), are always honoured, irrespective of this setting\&.
.sp
These settings take boolean arguments\&. If
"no", the inhibitor locks taken by applications are respected\&. If
"yes", "shutdown", "sleep", and "idle" inhibitor locks are ignored\&.
\fIPowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=\fR,
\fISuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=\fR, and
\fIHibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=\fR
default to
"no"\&.
\fILidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=\fR
defaults to
"yes"\&. This means that when
\fBsystemd\-logind\fR
is handling events by itself (no low level inhibitor locks are taken by another application), the lid switch does not respect suspend blockers by default, but the power and sleep keys do\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIHoldoffTimeoutSec=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the timeout after system startup or system resume in which elogind will hold off on reacting to LID events\&. This is required for the system to properly detect any hotplugged devices so elogind can ignore LID events if external monitors, or docks, are connected\&. If set to 0, elogind will always react immediately, possibly before the kernel fully probed all hotplugged devices\&. This is safe, as long as you do not care for elogind to account for devices that have been plugged or unplugged while the system was off\&. Defaults to 30s\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRuntimeDirectorySize=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the size limit on the
\fI$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fR
runtime directory for each user who logs in\&. Takes a size in bytes, optionally suffixed with the usual K, G, M, and T suffixes, to the base 1024 (IEC)\&. Alternatively, a numerical percentage suffixed by
"%"
may be specified, which sets the size limit relative to the amount of physical RAM\&. Defaults to 10%\&. Note that this size is a safety limit only\&. As each runtime directory is a tmpfs file system, it will only consume as much memory as is needed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRemoveIPC=\fR
.RS 4
Controls whether System V and POSIX IPC objects belonging to the user shall be removed when the user fully logs out\&. Takes a boolean argument\&. If enabled, the user may not consume IPC resources after the last of the user\*(Aqs sessions terminated\&. This covers System V semaphores, shared memory and message queues, as well as POSIX shared memory and message queues\&. Note that IPC objects of the root user and other system users are excluded from the effect of this setting\&. Defaults to
"yes"\&.
.RE
.SS "[Sleep] section:"
.PP
\fBelogind\fR
supports three general power\-saving modes:
.PP
suspend
.RS 4
a low\-power state where execution of the OS is paused, and complete power loss might result in lost data, and which is fast to enter and exit\&. This corresponds to suspend, standby, or freeze states as understood by the kernel\&.
.RE
.PP
hibernate
.RS 4
a low\-power state where execution of the OS is paused, and complete power loss does not result in lost data, and which might be slow to enter and exit\&. This corresponds to the hibernation as understood by the kernel\&.
.RE
.PP
hybrid\-sleep
.RS 4
a low\-power state where execution of the OS is paused, which might be slow to enter, and on complete power loss does not result in lost data but might be slower to exit in that case\&. This mode is called suspend\-to\-both by the kernel\&.
.RE
.PP
\fISuspendMode=\fR, \fIHibernateMode=\fR, \fIHybridSleepMode=\fR
.RS 4
The string to be written to
/sys/power/disk
by elogind\&. More than one value can be specified by separating multiple values with whitespace\&. They will be tried in turn, until one is written without error\&. If neither succeeds, the operation will be aborted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fISuspendState=\fR, \fIHibernateState=\fR, \fIHybridSleepState=\fR
